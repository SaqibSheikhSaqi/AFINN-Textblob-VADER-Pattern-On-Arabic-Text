      "Text: I would like to thank the director of the hero branch, Ahmed Abdel Aziz, Mr. Osama Abdou Ali, his tiredness and efforts with the clients, is the real concern of the manager who helps the clients himself in order to raise the level of the bank. I mean, in exceptional cases for the clients, the branch manager moves all the time and follows up on the elephant and the validity of the papers, and follows up on the client. He follows up on the employees by phone. After a few minutes, the employee is late with his paper. The manager moves immediately, helps the employees and comes back. His office finishes the rest of the signatures one minute and goes back to the other one. I am very surprised that there are still employees in Egypt who are at the top of the integrity of the site where it is after working hours. I felt that we have risen very much in our transactions now in Egyptian banks 👍❤️🤝 Thank you, the National Bank of Egypt, the hero Ahmed Abdel Aziz branch 👌\n",

I got number 12 and we got in right on opening time. This branch, due to its proximity to my house, frequented it a lot and expected at least two hours as usual. Today I found a system and a beehive, and after 15 minutes or less I was done. I asked if there was a new director, and as I expected, the answer was yes, a director on the second floor. Her good performance was reflected in all employees, even security. It was necessary to visit her office and congratulate her on this clear change and outstanding performance. These rare models deserve praise and salute.\n",
